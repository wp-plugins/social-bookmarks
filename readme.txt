Customization
-------------
Version 3 introduces an Options page in the WordPress admin section. You can select which sites you display, whether 
the links will open in a new window or in the current page. Also, you can change the heading that appears above the
links. If you have pages in your site then you can select a sub-set of them (or even all of them) where the links won't appear. You can also specify to display the links in one or two lines. You can set the plugin to be visible in the blog 
listing (index.php) and/or in the single post page.

The plugin is using a stylesheet (social_bookmarks.css) which you can modify to integrate it further with your theme. 

Finally, a PNG template file is included that can be used to generate additional icons.

I hope that you enjoy the plugin,
